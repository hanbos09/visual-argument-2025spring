Don't Get Tied Up In The Wrong Moment

This visual argument project is meant to represent the hold that technology has on us today. The COVID-19 pandemic had all of us under lockdown which caused many of us to turn to social media and the internet to keep us entertained and connected. However, while the pandemic has subsided, the effect that it had did not. It also doesn't help that advertising and media is meant to be invasive and keep our attention.

With this project I want to encourage people to spend less time on their phones and instead having fun with the people they care about. I wanted to keep the messaging light-hearted and joyful; trying to be more encouraging and inspiring by using light, bright pastel colors. I also went with illustration instead of real images because I wanted it to be more friendly and catch peoples' attention more. The darkest part of this project is the text, which I wanted to be bold but not in your face, and the symbolism of the hands being tied up by the charging cord. This project is meant to be a supportive message that important and fun moments and memories are waiting for you beyond your screen.

I started this project on GIMP but quickly ran into difficulty specifically with removing the background on my Phone layer. I decided to switch to Photoshop which I have previous experience with and found it much easier to use for me and what I wanted to accomplish.

My starting point was an Unsplash image of the phone with the charging cord wrapped around a person's wrists. This image stood out to me and was the base that inspired the rest of my image. I imported this image into photoshop and started removing the background by creating a mask and removing the parts I didn't want. I then went searching on Unsplash again for licensed photos that could work, but wanted to stick to and match the illustration style of the hands. I couldn't find an illustrated window that I liked on Unsplash or by a google search, so I thought to try out Photoshop's Generative Fill tool.

With the original prompt being "A window with people having fun outside", it made a few generations but they did not match the style I was looking for. I was able to use the hands as reference for the next generation, which gave me much better options, but still weren't fitting my prompt how I wanted. I then typed into the prompt "From the perspective of a person inside, show a window with people having fun outside". While I probably should have just asked for a window, I thought I could kill two birds with one stone with this prompt. I ended up choosing the third option that came up, however I didn't like the AI generated people outside the window, so I removed them with the paint tool and light blue shade.

Next, I wanted to find people to be outside the window. I searched Unsplash's illustrations and found a few options in the same art style that I wanted to use. I downloaded 4 characters to place in the window. After layering them and adding them to my image, I found that they didn't match and fit into my vision that I had. I had a difficult time fitting them into the space and making the perspective look natural, so I saved it as a separate project and went to search for other illustrations.

I then went to Storyset's website because they have free-use licensed illustrations. I searched for people and found a few options in a fun setting, but landed on the beach party image.  I changed the color to almost match the wall color of my background and downloaded it with the "no background" option, which removed clouds and extra details. I then added this image to my project and adjusted a few details and used the transform tool to fit them into the perspective.


I wanted the image itself to stand out the most and speak for itself, but added the text above the window "Don't get tied up in the wrong moment" to further establish the argument and position.


For this project I used illustrated images from Unsplash and Storyset, as well as Photoshop's Generative Fill tool.
