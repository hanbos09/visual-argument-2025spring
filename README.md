Don't Get Tied Up In The Wrong Moment
This visual argument project is meant to represent the hold that technology has on us today. The COVID-19 pandemic had all of us under lockdown which caused many of us to turn to social media and the internet to keep us entertained and connected. However, while the pandemic has subsided, the effect that it had did not.
With this project I want to encourage people to spend less time on their phones and instead with the people they care about.

For this project I used illustrated images from Unsplash. I still want to add more to the background/window portion of the image, but I am happy with the progress so far.
I plan to bolden the text and find a better position and maybe a better headline to get the message across, but I thought a lighthearted attitude would work best for this project.
